### Project 3: NFL Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing NFL play-by-play data, specifically focusing on various metrics related to play types, yardage gained, penalties, and game outcomes. The analysis is visualized through stacked bar charts that compare play outcomes (such as first downs and turnovers) for different types of plays (run or pass).

## Features

Play Type Analysis: Analyze how different types of plays (run vs. pass) result in first downs or turnovers.
Yardage Analysis: Calculate the total yards gained by teams and compare the performance of winning and losing teams.
Penalty Analysis: Review the number of penalties committed by teams, comparing the performance of winning and losing teams.
Turnover and Scoring Analysis: Study turnovers and scoring events (touchdowns, field goals) for each team.
Visualizations

## First Down vs Turnover by Play Type:
A stacked bar chart that shows how many first downs and turnovers on downs were achieved by different play types (run and pass).
Colors: Green for first downs and Red for turnovers.
Total Yards Gained:
Bar plot comparing the total yards gained by each team in a particular week, color-coded by win/loss status (green for winning teams and red for losing teams).
Penalties by Teams:
A comparison of penalties committed by winning and losing teams, visualized in a bar plot with green for winning teams and red for losing teams.
File Structure

## Project 3.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.
images/: Directory where all the visualizations generated by the project are saved.
Example: money_down.png (Visualization of first down vs turnover on downs by play type).
Setup Instructions

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries (install using pip):
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Running the Project
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Navigate to the project directory.
Open the Project 3.ipynb notebook using Jupyter:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Project\ 3.ipynb
Run the cells in the notebook to generate visualizations and analyze the data.
Key Dependencies
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations.
OS Module: To handle file path operations and ensure that output directories exist.
Usage

Once the notebook is running, the following steps will guide you through generating insights:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: The notebook will load and clean the NFL data, including handling missing values for yardage and penalties.
Analysis: Various calculations will be performed to compare the performance of teams in terms of yards gained, penalties, and turnovers.
Visualization: The results of the analysis will be presented in visual formats (bar charts, stacked bar charts) to aid in understanding the data trends.
Example Visualization



This chart visualizes the number of first downs versus turnovers on downs for run and pass plays. The green bars represent successful first downs, while the red bars represent turnovers on downs.

Future Enhancements

Additional breakdowns of the types of plays (e.g., deep passes vs. short passes).
Analyzing data across multiple weeks or seasons.
Incorporating advanced metrics like Expected Points Added (EPA).
