### NFL Week 1 Data Visualization Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize data from NFL Week 1 games in 2024. Using data visualization techniques, we extract insights into team performances, scoring trends, penalties, turnovers, and other game aspects. The goal is to create an interactive platform that allows users to explore this data through various charts and tables, making it easy for users of all levels to interact with and understand the results. The project employs Python and JavaScript libraries, such as matplotlib, seaborn, D3.js, and Plotly, for dynamic and interactive visualizations.

## Project Purpose

Analyze and visualize detailed game logs from Week 1 of the 2024 NFL season.
Provide a platform that enables users to explore data interactively, including insights on scoring trends, penalties, and turnovers by team.
Compare key statistics, such as average yards gained, penalties, and turnovers, between winning and losing teams.
Instructions for Use

## Prerequisites:
Python 3.x installed with the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and flask (if using the backend API).
Web browser to interact with the HTML interface (index.html) that displays the data visualizations.
Running the Project:
Clone the GitHub repository and navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script for generating visualizations from the provided dataset. The generated PNG files will be saved in the images/ folder.
Open index.html in a web browser to interact with dynamic charts generated using D3.js and Plotly.js.
The platform will allow you to select different games and view related plays and statistics interactively.
Interacting with the Project:
Users can filter visualizations by teams and specific game plays, with the ability to compare stats for winning and losing teams.
Use the dropdown menu to select individual games and view play-by-play analysis, with visual representations such as bar charts, scatter plots, and more.
Ethical Considerations

## In this project, we took the following ethical considerations into account:

#Data Privacy:# The dataset contains no personally identifiable information (PII) and is limited to publicly available statistics related to NFL games.
Bias and Fairness: Care was taken to avoid bias in data interpretation. We ensured that our visualizations and data models did not favor any teams or present skewed insights. Only raw statistical data was used, and no subjective criteria were applied in the analysis.
Intellectual Property: All external libraries and datasets used in this project are either open-source or publicly available under fair use guidelines.
Data Source(s)

NFL Week 1 Game Logs (2024): Detailed game logs were sourced from publicly available NFL play-by-play data, specifically for the 2024 season (play_by_play_2024.csv). A secondary dataset from the 2023 season was also considered for comparison.
Code References

The following external libraries and code were used in this project:

D3.js and Plotly.js for generating interactive visualizations in the browser (HTML/JavaScript).
Python libraries:
pandas and numpy for data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib and seaborn for creating static visualizations in Python.
Code for building dropdown menus and interacting with charts was adapted from D3.js and Plotly.js documentation.
